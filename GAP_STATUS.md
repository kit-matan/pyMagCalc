# pyMagCalc ↔ SpinW/Sunny feature-gap status

A running record of the gaps between pyMagCalc and SpinW/Sunny, what has been closed, and
what remains — written so a future session (AI or human) can pick up without re-deriving
the context. Keep it updated when a gap moves.

Reference oracle: **Sunny.jl 0.8.1** is checked out in-repo at
`../Sunny.jl-main`, and Julia 1.12 + Sunny 0.8.1 are installed. Use them (and textbook
analytic results) to validate every new feature — see "How things were validated" below.

Status: **merged to `master`** (PR #2). All of the below — Gap 1, Gap 2, Ewald
(Gap 3 #7), SU(N) (Gap 3 #1), 1/S corrections (#8), mCIF (#12), the Studio web +
native apps, and the Sunny.jl tutorial ports — now live on the default branch. The
two former development branches (`feature/sun-mode`, `feature/gap-closure-ewald`)
have been consolidated and retired; `feature/gap-closure-ewald` was fully contained
in the merge and is deleted.

Test suite: 208 tests (`python -m pytest tests`). Every new feature has a test that
pins it to an **independent reference** (Sunny, or an exact analytic identity), never a
self-generated golden number.

## Gap 1 — Intensity / experiment layer — ✅ CLOSED

The neutron-intensity / experiment surface. Config keys under `calculation:` and
`plotting:`, plus a task.

| Item | Status | Key(s) | Validated against |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bose thermal factor | ✅ | `calculation.temperature` (K) | Sunny `kT`; detailed balance |
| Domain / twin averaging | ✅ | `calculation.domains` (`{axis,n_fold}` or list) | manual twin average; exact for perp/trace |
| Cross-section selection | ✅ | `calculation.cross_section` (perp/trace/xx/…) | tensor sum rules |
| Instrument resolution | ✅ | `plotting.resolution` (`de_fwhm` poly, `dq_fwhm`, `ei`, `two_theta`, `shape`), `plotting.energy_grid_step` | SpinW `sw_instrument` (SW37) |
| 2-D constant-energy cuts | ✅ | `tasks.energy_cut` + `energy_cut:` block | SW10 |
| Polarized / chiral cross-sections | ✅ | `cross_section: chiral` / `sf±` | Sunny, proper-screw helix |

Tests: `tests/test_intensity_layer.py`, `tests/test_polarized.py`.

---

## Gap 2 — Hamiltonian terms — ✅ CLOSED

Terms beyond bilinear exchange. All under `interactions:` except the g-tensor (per atom)
and multi-k (magnetic_structure).

| Item | Status | Key | Validated against |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3×3 single-ion anisotropy | ✅ | `interactions.sia_matrix` | reduces to uniaxial `sia` |
| Stevens operators O_k^q (k=2/4/6) | ✅ | `interactions.stevens` | table generated from Sunny `stevens_matrices(Inf)`; O_2^0 identity |
| Anisotropic per-site g-tensor | ✅ | atom `g:` (scalar/diag/3×3/`{g_par,g_perp,axis}`) | g=2 ≡ legacy Zeeman; SW20 in field |
| Biquadratic exchange | ✅ | `interactions.biquadratic` | exact collinear map to 1e-15 |
| Long-range dipole-dipole (truncated) | ✅ | `interactions.dipole_dipole: {method: truncated, cutoff}` | Sunny truncated sum to 3e-8 |
| Multi-k structures | ✅ | `magnetic_structure: {type: multi_k}` + supercell (per-axis LCM) | one-component k=½ ≡ Néel chain |

**Two latent engine bugs fixed while doing this** (see CLAUDE.md; both were silent,
plausible-but-wrong):
1. The LSWT truncation filtered by *powers of S*, silently deleting every quartic term
   (biquadratic, Stevens O_4/O_6, whose quadratic-boson part carries S³). Now truncates
   by **boson degree**. Verified inert on all prior configs (dispersions byte-identical).
2. The classical energy ignored the g-tensor and assumed **B ∥ z** on the numeric-param
   path — which the minimizer uses — so it optimized a *different* Hamiltonian than LSWT
   diagonalized (wrong ground state, imaginary magnons). Field vector now resolved once.

Tests: `tests/test_hamiltonian_terms.py`.

## Gap 3 — Beyond dipole LSWT

### Tier 1 (affects results you would publish) — ✅ ALL DONE

| # | Item | Status | Key | Validated against |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SU(N) mode** | ✅ | `calculation.mode: SUN` | Sunny `:SUN` — FeI₂ energy, all 8 bands, AND intensities to 4e-7 |
| 2 | Fitting sees temperature/domains/cross_section | ✅ | (auto from `calculation:`) | ignoring T biased J by 17% |
| 3 | Mixed-spin intensity prefactor | ✅ | (per-site √(S_i/2)) | decoupled-sublattice identity (was 60% error) |
| 4 | Polarized / chiral cross-sections | ✅ | `cross_section` | Sunny (also listed under Gap 1) |

**SU(N) detail** (`magcalc/sun/`, `tests/test_sun.py`): a second LSWT engine (as in
Sunny). Each site carries an N=2S+1 level Hilbert space with a coherent state; N-1 bosons
per site; captures single-ion (multipolar) excitations dipole LSWT structurally cannot.
Validation gates, in order of how loudly they fail:
- **Gate 1** — S=1/2 (N=2) is *identical* to dipole LSWT (0.0e+00). Any convention error
  (phase, Bogoliubov metric, factors, on-site mean field) fails here.
- **Gate 2** — no single-ion terms: dipole bands reproduced; extras are flat Δm≥2 modes.
- **Gate 3** — single-ion anisotropy vs Sunny `:SUN` (4.7e-07), incl. the quadrupolar band.
- **FeI₂** — E/site −2.91893118, 8 bands + intensities to 4e-4, via the config bridge +
  a non-diagonal magnetic supercell + the CP^(N-1) ground-state search.

Runs on 38/47 example configs; the rest **refuse honestly** (incommensurate/spiral/auto-
supercell → not supported; mixed-spin → not yet; frustrated GS search not converging →
guard refuses). Never silently wrong.

### Tier 2 (capability parity)

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Finite-T classical dynamics (Langevin, SampledCorrelations) | ❌ | classical S(Q,ω) above T_N |
| 6 | Thermal Monte-Carlo (parallel tempering, Wang–Landau) | ❌ | ground-state MC done (`annealing.py`); thermal sampling not |
| 7 | **Ewald dipole-dipole** | ✅ | `dipole_dipole: {method: ewald}`; Sunny to 1.3e-8; truncated→Ewald convergence (needs no Julia). `tests/test_ewald.py` |
| 8 | **LSWT 1/S corrections** | ✅ | `tasks.corrections`; Sunny + textbook square AFM: dE=−0.157947, dS→0.1966. `magcalc/corrections.py`, `tests/test_corrections.py` |
| 9 | **SCGA (paramagnetic diffuse scattering)** | ✅ | `tasks: {scga: true}` + `scga: {temperature, mesh_density, cross_section}`. Self-consistent Gaussian approximation: classical spins, hard length constraint softened to a global Lagrange multiplier λ, static S(q) = kT·pref†(λ+J(q))⁻¹pref with λ from the spin sum rule. SAME `fourier_exchange_matrix` J(q) as the LT guard; single-λ (one symmetry class — Bravais + kagome/pyrochlore-type, refuses inequivalent sublattices). Above T_N, so the LSWT ground-state guard is auto-skipped for a pure-SCGA run. Validated: exact classical-chain closed form (λ=√(4J²+(3kT/S²)²), S(q)=3kT/(λ+2Jcosq)) to 1e-9; **Sunny 0.8.1 SCGA** on square-lattice AND kagome AFM — λ and S(q) to 6 digits (matches `ssf_perp`, apply_g, (2/3)Tr at q→0); sum rule + high-T flat limit. `magcalc/scga.py`, `tests/test_scga.py` |
| 10 | KPM / Lanczos | ❌ | large supercells without full diagonalization |
| 11 | **Entangled units** | ✅ | `calculation.mode: entangled` + `units:` -- a cluster (dimer/trimer/...) becomes ONE effective SU(N) site (N = product Hilbert dim). Intra-unit coupling diagonalized exactly (reference = the unit ground state, e.g. a dimer SINGLET -- zero dipole, invisible to dipole/single-site SU(N) LSWT); excitations are the triplons. Generalized the SU(N) engine (per-site operators, generalized bond couplings, q-dependent staggered moment). Validated: isolated dimer flat triplon at omega=J; coupled-dimer chain omega=sqrt(J^2-JJ'cos) (bond-operator) to 7e-16; dimer structure factor (1-cos(q.d)) with the I(q=0)=0 selection rule. Optional Zeeman field (gamma*mu_B*H.sum_k S_k per unit) splits the multiplet. REAL MATERIALS: `examples/entangled/Cu5SbO6/` reproduces the J1-J2-J4 dimer expansion of Piyakulworawat et al., PRR 8, 013247 (2026) -- triplon band ~11-21 meV, dispersion = the bond-operator resummation of the paper's Eq. (A11), structure-factor selection rule Eq. (A14). `examples/entangled/Rb2Cu3SnF12/` -- the pinwheel-VBS single-dimer building block (Matan et al., Nat. Phys. 6, 865 (2010)): DM splits the Stot^z=0 from the +/-1 triplet, a c-axis field Zeeman-splits +/-1 (Fig. 4); the full deformed-kagome dispersion needs the 6-dimer geometry + high-order series expansion (strong coupling), beyond harmonic bond-operator. `magcalc/sun/entangled.py`, `examples/entangled/dimer_chain/`, `tests/test_entangled_units.py` |
| 12 | **mCIF / magnetic space groups** | ✅ | `from_mcif:` + CLI `magcalc mcif`; Sunny on TbSb: identical sites + directions. `magcalc/mcif.py`, `tests/test_mcif.py` |

### Tier 3 (plumbing / cheap wins)

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | GS search sees q≠0 instabilities | ✅ | Luttinger-Tisza ordering-vector guard (`spiral_opt.ordering_wavevector` + a 3rd runner guard). Catches a q≠0 spiral GS the in-cell anneal/energy-audit provably cannot reach AND whose k=0 magnon spectrum comes back real-positive (blind to both older guards). Validated on the J1-J2 chain: LT k* = analytic `arccos(-J1/4J2)/2π` = 0.230053 to 1e-6; a FM supplied for it is now flagged with k* + the single_k/supercell fix. Zero false positives across all example configs. `tests/test_q_neq_0_instability.py` |
| 14 | Expose symmetry analyzer as CLI | ✅ | `magcalc symmetry <config> [--max-distance] [--json]` — space group, symmetry-inequivalent bond orbits, and the symmetry-ALLOWED exchange matrix per bond (Sunny `print_symmetry_table` analogue). New reusable `MagCalcConfigBuilder.from_config`. Validated: P4/mmm NN bond forced diagonal (analytic); Yb2Ti2O7 allowed form == the physical SpinW/Sunny matrix's zero/tie pattern. `tests/test_symmetry_cli.py` |
| 15 | Broken `aCVO/config.yaml` (+ `KFe3J/config.yaml`) | ✅ | both were legacy `python_model_file` configs superseded by `config_acvo.yaml` / `config_kfe3j.yaml`; **retired** (untracked + git-ignored, kept locally). Fixed 2 general runner bugs kept: clear error for missing `crystal_structure`; `hasattr(model,'minimize')` no longer matches imported scipy. `tests/test_config_robustness.py` |

## Delivered alongside, not on the original gap list

- **High-order dimer series expansion + Dlog-Padé** (`magcalc/sun/dimer_series.py`):
  the linked-cluster method of Matan et al. (Nat. Phys. 6, 865 (2010) / PRB 89,
  024414 (2014)) for STRONG-coupling dimer magnets, where the harmonic entangled
  engine fails. Numerical Bloch/des Cloizeaux PT per cluster, subcluster subtraction
  (cluster additivity asserted numerically), per-band eigenvalue series, Dlog-Padé
  with the approximant spread as the uncertainty. Config:
  `calculation: {mode: entangled, series_order: N}`. Validated: alternating-chain ED
  (5e-4 J at J'/J=0.4; <8% at the gap at J'/J=0.8, order 7), PRR Eq. (A11) exact at
  order 1, λ^(n+1) error scaling vs exact diagonalization. On the Rb2Cu3SnF12
  pinwheel (J2=0.95 J1, dz=0.18, bond families assigned by Cu-F-Cu angle from the
  CIF — 138.3°/123.3° matching the papers' 138°/124°): the Γ doublet lands at
  2.2±1.0 meV (order 4, Dlog-Padé) vs the measured 2.35 meV; the papers' order 8
  remains the converged answer. `tests/test_dimer_series.py`,
  `examples/entangled/Rb2Cu3SnF12/series_dispersion.py`.
- **Monte-Carlo / annealing ground-state minimizer** (`magcalc/annealing.py`): SpinW
  `anneal` (Metropolis + cooling, Sunny `LocalSampler` proposal mix) and `optmagsteep`
  (`method: steep`). On SW20-in-field, multistart L-BFGS hit the true minimum in only
  3/200 starts; annealing finds it in 1 run. Now the recommended `minimization.method`.
- **Two-part ground-state guard** (runner, `on_imaginary: error|warn|off`): an
  imaginary-mode check AND an energy audit (perturb-and-relax). The run FAILS on a
  non-minimum instead of drawing a plausible-but-wrong spectrum. Caught a real shipped
  bug (SW20 zero-field was not at its ground state). The energy audit is necessary
  because a stationary *maximum* (or a wrong SU(N) reference) returns a real, positive,
  plausible spectrum the imaginary check cannot see.
- **Studio (web + native) controls**: minimization method picker, Ground-State Check,
  LSWT engine (dipole/SU(N)), temperature, cross-section, 1/S corrections task. The new
  interaction *types* (biquadratic/Stevens/3×3 SIA/dipole-dipole/g-tensor/multi-k),
  energy-cut, resolution, and mCIF are NOT in the GUI yet (need bond/matrix editors);
  they work via the config/CLI today.

## How things were validated (and the recurring trap)

The single most important lesson from this work, stated for the next session:

**A check that a wrong answer passes is not a check.** The engine has repeatedly produced
plausible-but-wrong spectra that looked fine:
- the S-power filter silently deleting quartic terms;
- the classical energy optimizing a different Hamiltonian than LSWT diagonalized;
- a mixed-spin intensity off by 60% (a constant factor, easy to wave through);
- SU(N) intensities off by exactly ×L (per-site normalization);
- a **stationary maximum** returning a real, positive spectrum (invisible to the
  imaginary-mode check — only the energy audit catches it);
- a dipole-derived state used as an SU(N) reference (a good local minimum, so again
  invisible to the imaginary check).

Every one was caught by an **independent oracle or an exact identity**, never by
inspection. So: validate against Sunny (in-repo) or a textbook analytic result; prefer
identities (decoupled-sublattice sum, S=1/2 SU(N)≡dipole, ferromagnet has zero
corrections) that fail loudly; and be suspicious of a discrepancy that is a *clean
constant factor*.

**A published reference number is not automatically a converged one.** Sunny's own FeI₂
example converges to a *local* minimum (E/site −2.35592338, one `minimize_energy!`); the
true ground state (−2.91893118) needs restarts. Days were spent "debugging" against a
non-converged reference. Re-minimize the reference before trusting it.

Key conventions worth knowing before touching the engine:
- pyMagCalc stores `HMat(q) = g · H2(q)` with H2 Hermitian, g = diag(I,−I); eigenvalues
  are the ±ω pairs. (The name `_build_TwogH2_matrix` is just a name.)
- Bonds are listed in BOTH directions with NO 1/2 on the hopping — this is how
  `H = (1/2) Σ_ordered` is encoded. The on-site (mean-field / local-field) term is the
  q=0 sum, NO phase (a phase there makes a ferromagnet's H(q) cancel to zero).
- The dipole ground state ≠ the SU(N) ground state when an anisotropy is present
  (a coherent state has ⟨Sz²⟩ ≠ (S n_z)²). Find the SU(N) GS in SU(N).
